      <h1>MANUP - Help</h1>
      <p>
        Fewer men are diagnosed with common mental health disorders such as
        depression and anxiety but that is not because men don't struggle with
        their mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research shows that men are much less likely to talk about their
        problems, to go to the GP or ask for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often they face pressure to be strong, to 'man up' or they are told that
        'boys don't cry'. Many feel that mental ill-health is seen as a
        weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men are more likely to use alcohol or other substances to help them cope
        with problems. They are also more likely to kill themselves 
        approximately three quarters of people who die by suicide in the UK are
        men.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that "it's okay not to be okay". Talking about it
        helps!
