      <p>You don't need to be an athlete to exercise. Although it can sometimes be daunting, making the first step and starting to exercise can often be the most rewarding thing you can do. However it is worth remembering that you wont get results overnight. Rome wasn&apos;t built in a day and neither was an athletes level of fitness. You have to be dedicated but you can can there!</p>
